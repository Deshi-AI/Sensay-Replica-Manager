# Sensay Replica Manager ü§ñ

This Streamlit application provides a web-based interface to manage and interact with [Sensay.io](https://sensay.io/) AI Replicas. It allows users to:

*   **Configure** API credentials for Sensay and Supabase.
*   **Create** new Sensay Replicas, defining their properties like name, owner, and LLM.
*   **List and View** existing Replicas within a Sensay organization, with filtering options.
*   **Train (or Retrain)** Replicas using text data (e.g., Slack messages) stored in a Supabase database.
*   **Test and Chat** interactively with trained Replicas directly within the application.

The primary use case demonstrated is training Replicas based on Slack user messages archived in Supabase, effectively creating AI digital twins or knowledge repositories.
